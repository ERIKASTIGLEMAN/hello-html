Pure Powder!

Are you Sun or Ski?
Personal I could take either! The skier with the adrenaline rush of playing in the snow or the sunner, the lazy one, with the need for a good book while sipping on a drink.

Many may ask, why would anyone in their right mind voluntarily choose clunky heavy boots, several layers of clothing, a helmet, face mask, and googles, and then strap two sticks to their feet and hurl themselves headlong down a mountain
It’s the exhilaration is well worth the work!

Don’t get me wrong if a butler was offered to carry the skis, the jackets, and the goggles, I certainly would not turn one down. 

I love the sport as a family adventure, as well. If you are not a snow dweller, do wait until they are old enough to carry themselves. Or this could take the word adventure completely out of description. Skiing challenges us, it is about us conquering our fears and mastering a new skill together and individually. We come together around a fireplace telling stories of the day’s journey, laughing under the stars.
