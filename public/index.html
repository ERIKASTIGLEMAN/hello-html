  <h2> Are you Sun or Ski?</h2>
  <p>
    Personal I could take either! The skier with the adrenaline rush of playing in the snow or the sunner, the lazy one,
    with the need for a good book while sipping on a drink.
  </p>
  <p>
    Many may ask, why would anyone in their right mind voluntarily choose clunky heavy boots, several layers of
    clothing, a helmet, face mask, and googles, and then strap two sticks to their feet and hurl themselves headlong
    down a mountain
  </p>
  <p>
    The <strong>exhilaration</strong> is well worth the work!
  </p>

  <p>
    Don’t get me wrong if a stewart was offered to carry the skis, the jackets, and the goggles, I certainly would not
    turn one down.

    I love the sport as a family adventure, as well. If you are not a snow dweller, do wait until they are old enough to
    carry themselves. Or this could take the word adventure completely out of description. Skiing challenges us, it is
    about us conquering our fears and mastering a new skill together and individually.

  <p>
    We come together around a fireplace
    telling stories of the day’s journey, laughing under the stars.
